# NRK Player

A native Android TV app for NRK content, built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and ExoPlayer/Media3.

The project explores three ideas that don't exist in the current NRK TV app:

1. **60-second Digest mode** — on-device scene analysis picks the best 10 clips from any programme and stitches them into a one-minute highlight reel, entirely without a server.
2. **Live subtitle translation** — ML Kit translates Norwegian subtitles to any supported language in real time, rendering the translated line in gold beneath the original.
3. **Automatic credits detection** — the manifest's `endSequenceStartTime` field drives a "Skip credits →" prompt that appears a few seconds before the credits roll.

## Tech

| | |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin (2.0, K2 compiler) |
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| Video | Media3 / ExoPlayer (HLS + DASH, OkHttp data source) |
| DI | Koin |
| Networking | Retrofit + kotlinx.serialization |
| Storage | Room (watch progress + digest cache) |
| ML | ML Kit Text Recognition (Norwegian) · ML Kit Translation |
| Image loading | Coil |
| Tests | JUnit 4 + Robolectric |
| Architecture | Single-activity, MVVM, unidirectional data flow |

Zero third-party UI libraries. Everything you see is hand-written Compose.

## Digest mode

The scene-scoring pipeline:

```
Stream URL
    │
    ▼
ExoPlayer seeked to N evenly-spaced keyframes
    │
    ▼
Bitmap captured at each position (BitmapExtractor)
    │
    ▼
64-bin HSV hue histogram per frame
    │
    ▼
χ²(H₁, H₂) = Σ (H₁ᵢ - H₂ᵢ)² / (H₁ᵢ + H₂ᵢ)   ← lighting-invariant distance
    │
    ▼
Top-N frames by score, spread to avoid clustering   ← min-gap enforcement
    │
    ▼
DigestSegment list (startMs, endMs, sceneScore, subtitleSnippet)
    │
    ▼
Persisted in Room (DigestCacheEntity) — never recomputed for same ID
```

Each segment is 6 seconds. Ten segments × 6 s = exactly 60 seconds of playback. The engine skips the first and last 5% of the programme to avoid cold opens and credits polluting the digest.

## Subtitle translation

`NrkPlayerController` listens for `Player.Listener.onCues()` and forwards each cue to an `ML Kit Translator` (Norwegian → target language). The translated text appears in a gold subtitle line beneath the original.

Language model download (~15 MB per language) happens once in the background. After that, translation is fully offline.

---

## Running it

Requires Android Studio Koala or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NRKPlayer
```

Open in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, then run on an API 26+ device or emulator.

No API keys required. The app calls the same public NRK PS API used by nrk.no — note that some content is geo-restricted to Norway.

---

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

`DigestEngineTest` covers HSV histogram normalisation and colour fidelity, χ² distance identity/symmetry/non-negativity, segment selection ordering and valid time ranges, subtitle cue attachment and edge cases like zero-score frames and very short content.

## What's next

- [ ] Universal accessibility: TalkBack labels on all controls, contrast ratios validated with `AccessibilityInsights`
- [ ] Offline download with `Media3 Downloader` + foreground `WorkManager` service
- [ ] Android TV / Leanback layout with D-pad navigation
- [ ] `MediaSession` integration for notification controls and Android Auto
- [ ] Picture-in-picture support
